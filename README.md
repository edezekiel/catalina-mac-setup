# ubi-mac-setup

This is my first step in setting up a new mac computer.

It primarily uses HomeBrew to install fundamental apps and packages (Slack, Zoom, node, Visual Studio Code, etc).

**IF you have already created a .zshrc or .vimrc configuration file, your settings will be lost.**


- If you want to make Visual Studio Code your defuault IDE simply follow these instructions:
  1. Enter this in your terminal: `cd $HOME && open .zshrc`
  2. Follow the instructions on lines 14 and 15 ("go to vscode, enter CMD + SHIFT ..."
  2. Uncomment line 16 so it reads `export EDITOR="code -w"
  3. Save the file (CMD + S)
